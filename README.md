### My first react app.

This project is for practicing react js.
Using the pokemon api to fetch a list of pokemon using Axios.
The basic functionality of this application is to pull pokemon from an open sourced api, display them through a PokemonCards component that acts as an individual Card for each pokemon.
Each Card is clickable and unmounts the Pokemon Cards, and mounts a PokemonDetail component.
The PokemonDetail component shows the stats and image of the selected pokemon.
There is a back button which returns you to the previous page which is handled using the useNavigate hook to pass a path and returns to the searchbar the offset of the page you were previously on which is stored in the useLocation hook by getting the state. The current offset is sent as a prop to the PokemonCards.

Bootstrap was used for the styling with some custom css.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
